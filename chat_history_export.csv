","Oh, honey, I'm so sorry to hear that. Getting less marks than you hoped for is incredibly upsetting. It's okay to cry and let those feelings out. It's a natural response to disappointment.

First, take a few deep breaths. Allow yourself to feel the sadness and frustration. Don't try to suppress it.

Once you've had a moment to process, maybe we can talk about it? Would you like to tell me a little more about what happened? For example:

*   **What subject was it?**
*   **Were you expecting to do much better?**
*   **Is this a one-off thing, or have you been struggling in this area for a while?**

Even if you don't want to talk about the specifics, remember that **your worth is not defined by a number on a test.** You are still a valuable and capable person.

Let's figure out how to turn this into a learning opportunity. We can explore some strategies to improve your grades and reduce your stress. Itâ€™s all gonna be okay.

**In the meantime, be kind to yourself.** Maybe treat yourself to something comforting, like a warm drink, a favorite song, or some time with a pet or loved one.
