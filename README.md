## Introduction

### Project Overview

Serenify is a web application that acts as a personalized emotional wellness companion, enabling users to understand, track, and improve their mental and emotional state using multimodal AI interactions. The system combines conversational AI, real-time facial emotion recognition, sentiment analysis, and guided growth features to provide a comprehensive emotional wellness platform.

### Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced world, individuals face increasing mental health challenges with limited access to professional support.

By combining real-time emotion detection, personalized insights, and guided growth opportunities, Serenify empowers users to develop greater emotional awareness and resilience in their daily lives.
